# Hand-written-digit-classification Using KNN Algorithm
## **Project Brief:**
The aim of this project is to identify the handwritten digits taken from the MNIST dataset using the KNN algorithm.
## **Technical Stacks Used:**
1. Python
2. Numpy
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib
## **KNN Algorithm**
K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a type of supervised ML algorithm which can be used for both classification as well as regression predictive problems. However, it is mainly used for classification predictive problems in industry. The following two properties would define KNN well −

1. **Lazy learning algorithm** − KNN is a lazy learning algorithm because it does not have a specialized training phase and uses all the data for training while classification.
2. **Non-parametric learning algorithm** − KNN is also a non-parametric learning algorithm because it doesn’t assume anything about the underlying data.
## **MNIST Dataset**
The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset.

It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28×28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.

The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively.

It is a widely used and deeply understood dataset and, for the most part, is “solved.” Top-performing models are deep learning convolutional neural networks that achieve a classification accuracy of above 99%, with an error rate between 0.4 %and 0.2% on the hold out test dataset.
## **Future Scope**
1. **Banking System:** KNN can be used in banking system to predict weather an individual is fit for loan approval? Does that individual have the characteristics similar to the defaulters one?
2. **Calculating Credit Ratings:** KNN algorithms can be used to find an individual’s credit rating by comparing with the persons having similar traits.
3. **Politics:** With the help of KNN algorithms, we can classify a potential voter into various classes like “Will Vote”, “Will not Vote”, “Will Vote to Party ‘Congress’, “Will Vote to Party ‘BJP’.

Other areas in which KNN algorithm can be used are Speech Recognition, Handwriting Detection, Image Recognition and Video Recognition.
## **Conclusion**
1. Learnt supervised machine learning using KNN Algorithm.
2. Classified the hand written digits from the MNSIT Algorithm
3. These concepts can further be extended to develop more models.
